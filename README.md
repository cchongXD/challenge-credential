# Credential

## problem statement

- Especially during pandemic, it's very hard to ensure the genuineness of everyone's credentials. Credentials verification is lack of transparency not tamper-proof.
- Apart from test results (which could be easily compromised), governments have no way of verifying if a patient has had COVID-19 and is virus-free. What solution can provide tamper-proof while retrievable data only with the right credentials by leveraging Maxonrow's NFT? 

## example solution

- A methodology or solution to store huge amount of incorruptible records of credentials
- A methodology or solution to transform digital identity into decentralized identity
- A methodology or solution to capture, record & verify special credentials accurately
